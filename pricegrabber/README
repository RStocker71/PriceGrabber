PriceGrabber
------------

Purpose: Extracts price and other product data from websites

Prerequisites:
- Install Apache Maven and add 'mvn' to PATH or create a symbolic link to /usr/bin
- Download platform specific OCR library from http://asprise.com/product/ocr/download.php?lang=java
- Put the native library (either xx.dll, xx.jnilib, or xx.so) to java.library.path (ex. /usr/lib/java)

Selector definitions:
- for each domain to grad from, add a <domain>.properties file to src/main/resources/selectors
- have a look on the two existing files. selectors use XPath syntax. the rest should be self-explaining.

Build: from the project root directory run
> mvn jetty:run

Run: open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/pricegrabber
